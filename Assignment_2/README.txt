2. Run the following command to create an environment `conda create -n assignment1 python=3.10`
3. Once the environment has been created run `conda deactivate` and then `conda activate assignment2` to activate environment
4. Scikit-learn package is needed to run the notebook. Run `conda install -c intel scikit-learn` to install it 
5. Run `conda install matplotlib` and `conda install seaborn`. These packages are used to produce plots
6. Run `conda install jupyterlab` 
7. Run `pip install dataframe_image`
8. Run `pip install mlrose_hiive`
9. Run `conda install pandas`
10. Run `conda install ipykernel'
11. Run `python -m ipykernel install --user --name assignment2 --display-name "assignment2"`
12. Download the breast cancer dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data 
13. Save the assignment notebook using the link above in the same directory as the datasets.
14. Run `jupyter lab` in the directory of the notebook. 
15. Run the notebook using the 'assignment2' kernel.
